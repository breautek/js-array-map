# js-array-map

JavaScript library for handling complex array structures that need to expand in multiple directions, while still maintaining index ordering (without changing the indices). 

I may change the API significantly in the future, therefore use at your own risk. If/When I decide to stick with this library, I'll add tests, documentation, and a bunch of other fun stuff.
